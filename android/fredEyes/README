=== README for FredEyes ===
Contributors: Yiqi Zeng, Harry Eakins
Requires at least: Andorid 3.2, API version 13

This application is written for 
Imperial College Electrical and Electronic Department 4th year course Human Centred Robotics.
It displays two eyes on a Android device screen to show the expression and focus of a robot.

=== Use this application ===
Inputs:
 	1. Focus, it is a location variable (x,y,z) where x is the horizontal directon, y is vertical and z is distance
 	   All of x, y, z are integers in the range of -1000 to 1000
 	2. Hapiness, it is an integer variable in the range of -10 to 10
 	
Focus and mood to display can be controlled wirelessly through the Apache Thrift service.
The python file py-impl/EyesRosSubscriber.py can act as a translator between ROS node and the Thrift
and make this application subsribe to a ROS node
py-impl/FredEyesPyExample is a example python code to change focus and mood manually.

=== notes in installing ===
1. The eyes are displayed on a landscape screen, currently on a Motorola xzoom.

2. To stop/remove/disable the system bar, run the following codes in adb:
	$ service call activity 79 s16 com.android.systemui
   To restore the system bar just simply issue this command:
	$ am startservice -n com.android.systemui/.SystemUIService

=== further developement ===
1. more expressions can be achieved by adding more eye masks in teh res/drawable-mdpi and edit the emotionMask and freePupilSpace info accordingly in FredEyesActivity.jav
2. change all the hard coded numbers in the FredEyesActivity to be numbers scaled according to screen size to make this application suitable for other devices
